Dabral, a visiting faculty at IIT Delhi, and in 2017, I initiated the Uttarakhand Teaching Project in collaboration with NSS IIT Delhi to bridge the educational gap in remote areas of Uttarakhand.",
        "What started as a small effort has now grown into a life-changing initiative, empowering students from Narayan Bagar, Saikot, Dugadda, Paukhal, and beyond. Each year, talented and motivated students from these regions participate in our intensive residential learning program, guided by IIT Delhi students. Through structured teaching, mentorship, and motivation, we aim to help them excel in board exams and competitive entrance tests like JEE and NEET.",
        "The success stories of our students inspire us to continue and expand our efforts. My vision is to create an ecosystem of learning where every deserving student gets the right guidance and support to achieve their dreams, regardless of their background. I invite educators, volunteers, and well-wishers to join us in this journey of empowering the youth through education.",
